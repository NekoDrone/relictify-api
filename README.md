# Relictify API

This project is a simple backend API service for [Relictify](https://github.com/NekoDrone/Relictify).
This API is RESTful, and is used to load configurations for the app.

The stats and information used in creating this API is taken from the [HSR Fandom Wiki](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/).

## Usage

This API is not meant to be publicly accessible without the correct auth token(s).\
If you would like access to the API, you can fork the project, and host the API on your own.

The data provided is for reference, and will be updated as Honkai: Star Rail is updated.
